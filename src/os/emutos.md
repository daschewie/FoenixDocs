# EmuTOS

[EmuTOS](https://emutos.sourceforge.io/) is an open-source rewrite of the Atari ST operating system, the TOS. TOS/EmuTOS is a single-tasking operating system, which includes Digital Research's GEM (Graphics Environment Manager) and a desktop application. As a bonus, EmuTOS includes a minimalistic CLI called EmuCON.

EmuTOS is being ported to the A2560U by Vincent Barrilliot, as [genxtos](https://github.com/vinz6751/genxtos). While the port is in development (no GEM yet) and there is no readily usable flash image, you can contact the author for details as the OS (uploadable to RAM) can already run a development tool chain, and many command line tools.

For example, it is possible to use the Pure C compiler, Assemble, and other command line-based tools. Because of TOS compatibility, it is also possible to use cross-developments tools like GCC m68k release from Vincent Rivi√®re or Thorsten Otto.

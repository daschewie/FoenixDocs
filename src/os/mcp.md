# FoenixMCP

[Foenix MCP](https://github.com/pweingar/FoenixMCP) is a kernel by Peter Weingartner written using the VBCC C compiler. It features a FAT file system, testing tools for the Foenix chipset, a minimalistic CLI, and can load various program formats. The latest version doesn't work yet on the A2560U as it was refactored for the A2560K.

# Introduction

Welcome to the Foenix Project! Here you will find a series of brand new computers lovingly made by Stefany Allaire in the style of the early 16 and 32 bit machines of lore! This is your chance to be a participant in the development of a new platform - to start with a brand new machine akin to a high-end Atari or Amiga, write its very first programs, see what it can do, push its limits, and experience something new! Models are available with a 65816 CPU, a 680x0 series CPU, or both, with more CPU options planned for the future.

## All Foenix systems include the following base features

| Graphics               | Layers                     | Sound                       | Ports                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| 320x240x60fps          | 16x16 mouse pointer        | 2x Gideon FPGASID           | SD Card slot           |
| 400x300x60fps          | 8x8 character plane        | 16-bit stereo CODEC         | 2x PS/2 (kbd/mouse)    | 
| 640x480x60fps          | 64 16x16x256 sprites       | TI SN76489 (Sega, Cabinets) | Stereo 1/8" headphone  | 
| 800x600x60fps          | 4x 16x16x256 tile planes   | Yamaha OPL3 (Sound Blaster) | Stereo RCA Line In/Out | 
| 24-bit RGB color space | 2x 256-color bitmap planes | 3KHz piezo beeper           | 2.5" internal IDE HDD  |

## Additional features vary by class of unit


|          | 65816   | 680x0  |                                                                             | 
|----------|---------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Basic    | C256U   | A2560U | Basic units with 3-wire serial and an expansion port.                       | 
| Luxury   | C256FMX | A2560K | Expanded units with MIDI, floppy, 9-wire serial, 25-pin parallel, and more! | 
| Explorer | Gen-X   | Gen-X  | All of the above plus support for two CPUs!                                 |

## FAQ

* Is this another FPGA Retro like the MiSTer?
  * No! These machines are the real thing. You'll be running on a real 65816, 68000, 68040, i486dx2, etc. :).

* Are these machines compatible with the C64? C128? Amiga? Atari-ST? IBM-PC?
  * No! This is not a MEGA65, a Vampire, or an Ultimate64. We already have those platforms. This is something new and different!

* Is there an emulator?
  * Yes! See the Emulators page!

* Is the hardware "Open Source"?
  * The schematics are available for download from the Discord. The FPGA code is presently closed-source to keep the platform from becoming fragmented.

* Are there any programming tutorials for the Foenix?
  * Stefany Allaire's [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNX2L8_enbRUAb8zKaR2KzQ)
  * Tail Recursive's [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNLxfepc0xAZodcvOlVenQ)
  * You can also follow along with the development of the Gen-X on Stefany's [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c256foenix?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=creatorshare) page.
Happy hacking!
